This design will allow the user to create apparent systems of lights and such, along the lines of traditional Christmas outdoor house lighting. The design will include the hardware to steer the laser as well as the software to take in the user display information and render it on the house.&ampquot"},{"project_id":2017662,"project_title":"Time-of-Flight Distance Measuring","project_status":"Open","project_short_description":"The Time-of-Flight (ToF) principle is a method for measuring the distance between a sensor and an object, based on the time difference between the emission of a signal and its return to the sensor after being reflected by an object. This ToF distance measuring project includes creating a hardware platform and writing software to collect data and then analyzing data in MATLAB, \n\nDuring this project, you will develop: \n\n- the data acquisition (DAQ) platform based on MATLAB to collect the ToF data of optical sensors \n\n- and the processing software based on MATLAB to extract the range information \n\nThen, given the modeling in MATLAB, you will verify the measurements and accuracy of the models"},{"project_id":2017640,"project_title":"Machine Learning-Based Prediction of Currency Movements","project_status":"Open","project_short_description":"Predicting the movements and shifts in currencies using machine learning analysis"},{"project_id":2017677,"project_title":"Online textbooks service","project_status":"Open","project_short_description":"As a university student, textbooks are an essential part of our lives. Due to the increasing costs of physical books and the tremendous growth of eBooks, some students prefer to purchase eTextbooks instead. Currently, there are several companies (Amazon, Chegg, etc) that allow users to purchase eTextbooks on a one-by-one basis. Although this is cheaper than purchasing the physical copies of the book, it still can add up to a large sum of money.\n\n\n\nWe suggest an alternative to the current model of purchasing each textbook at a time. Using our web-based eTextbook service, users can subscribe and have access to our entire library of eTextbooks by paying an affordable, subscription monthly fee. Through the service, users will be able to access the entire database of textbooks and they can view each book through a PDF reader. The books will only be available online and there will not be a download option. As soon as the subscription expires, users will no longer have access to the textbook database."}]
