{"project_id":2017505,"project_title":"Human biometric recognition based on eye blinking","project_status":"Open","project_short_description":"The goal of this project is to develop and test a biometric recognition system using Electro-Oculo-Gram (EOG) signals. EOG signal is the electrical recording of the eyeball and eyelid movements by means of electrode placed near the eye. EOG signals have some advantages over conventional biometric traits such as using finger-print and facial characteristics. These signals cannot be easily forged nor be captured at a distance like fingerprint and face. They are one dimensional, low frequency signals that can be easily processed. They are also distinct between different persons due to the unique physiology of each individual. These properties has motivated research on the feasibility of EOG biometric systems for user verification and authentication.","project_detailed_description":"The goal of this project is to develop and test a biometric recognition system using Electro-Oculo-Gram (EOG) signals.
